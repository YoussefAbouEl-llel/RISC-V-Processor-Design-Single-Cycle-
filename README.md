# RISC-V-Processor-Design-Single-Cycle-
This project implements a single-cycle RISC-V processor in Verilog, designed to execute a subset of the RISC-V RV32I instruction set. The CPU follows a classic single-cycle architecture where all instruction stages (fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back) complete within a single clock cycle.
